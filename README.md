# Model-Of-VR
VR Platform Project on Solidworks
  This is just design for VR. And this solution is for shops or public areas.
  Model of VR can read the acts like up-down rotate left-right.
  Also it can move with up parts 360*degree and down parts 360* degree.
  Gas or break pedals activing when user use to vehicle.These triangles are pulling up and down.
  it has  8 piston  4 down part for ground movement simulation, 4 in the 4 legs for little movements like.
  model of vr has 6 motor. 2 big motor on the down side for 360* rotation 
  And 4 little motor on the up side user holder part for acts like rotate and resist.
  Ground has to function rotate and up-down origin base.when user climb the hill, model of vr configure it.
  4 leg connetions are not fixed together.these has half independency.Because of when user crouch , legs will support to crouch angle.
  model of vr will have seat for user. it can open and close while playing. it depends to user. 
  by the way user can play gta v with script addon(it will write with LUA script Lang.).
  he can use any vehicle or plane.it will rotate automaticly.Or when he shooted from enemy, he will feel impact from Model Of VR.
  System will work on rasperry pi or arduino.it depends to performance.
  Pistons will work air.Air also giving us some suspension effect. Compressor must be on the outside and covered with sound barriers.
  Motors will work electricity.
  4 leg will has some controller for configure the pistons sense-able.
  4 will have break point for the seat position.
